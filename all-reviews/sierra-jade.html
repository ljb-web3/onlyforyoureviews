        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
          <p>Alt tattoo girls are not particularly my type, but I'm also not here to date or fuck, just to get off. Sierra is really pretty with a magnetic scary gaze, and I really wanted to see girl-on-girl action that is intimate, passionate, and hopefully kinky and rough. Lesbian sex doesn't always have to be sweet, soft, and disgustingly romantic, am I right?</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>She is perfect for you if ...</h4>
            <p>You love really amateur, indie porn; you LOVE POV; and you value authenticity and intimacy over production and editing.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Her OnlyFans page is really raw, homemade, punk. I mean, all those bathroom selfies and borderline blurry pics! The word "realness" comes to mind when I think about her page. And because I like pretty girls doing pretty porn, it seemed a bit too low-effort for me - which is nothing surprising knowing that it's a $6.66 NO PPV page.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="content-quality">
          <h2>Her content is giving porn punk realness</h2>
          
          <h3>Content quality</h3>
          <p>If you are looking for "hot Instagram influencer secret page" vibes, this is certainly not the page for you. Her page feels like sexy snapshots from a private camera roll that no one was supposed to see. No edits, no posed shots, just her looking straight into the camera in a sexy-scary way.</p>

          <p>There's a diary-like quality to her content. It feels less like a curated brand and more like the horny sex journal of a kinky girl experimenting with a camera. Her OnlyFans page is real, and because it is real, it is extremely imperfect.</p>

          <p>Some watch amateur porn to see real sex by real people; some want to be immersed in a fantasy. I guess I am more part of the second category. For example, I watched a POV boy-girl scene that starts with a short spoken intro where Sierra talks about how excited she was to shoot. It was really cute, and it seemed like authentic slutty joy.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="girl-on-girl">
          <h2>What about her girl on girl content ?</h2>
          
          <p>Back to pussy ! Let me review some full lenght clips for you.</p>

          <h3>Kitchen scene #1</h3>
          <p>One G/G video featuring her girlfriend eating her out in the kitchen left me feeling a bit confused. It was just so fucking awkward. And confusion is not what you want to feel watching porn; the vibe felt somewhat off, almost forced.</p>

          <p>Sierra looks at the camera a bit too often, and not in a seductive way. It gave the impression that she wasn't fully comfortable or present, or maybe just not that into her partner. I never had my pussy eaten in the standing position by a gorgeous woman, and it honestly didn't make me want to try it.</p>

          <p>The video ends with no fade-out, no clean cut, which honestly caught me off guard as an adult content creator myself. Sierra casually just walks up to the camera and stops the recording herself. Just like that. And that really captures the raw, indie feel of her page: this is just her having sex and sharing it.</p>

          <h3>"Eating out my girlfriend for dinner"</h3>
          <p>There's another video with another kitchen reference. The girlfriend moans as Sierra eats her pussy just loudly enough to not seem fake. She dirty-talks throughout the scene, and it works because it doesn't feel too exaggerated. The problem is that the girlfriend carried the whole scene, and it's not even her page. Yes, amateur porn has to feel authentic, but it doesn't mean that it has to be boring. Come on Sierra, give us something.</p>

          <p>The girlfriend is getting her pussy eaten while filming herself at one point, and because of that, the angle is not really flattering. But I have to admit that I'm not into POV. It happens that there is a lot of POV on that page, unfortunately for me.</p>

          <h3>"Late night talks"</h3>
          <p>Then, I get to watch a girl-on-girl video that uses a tripod. Yeah! It's such a relief to see a stable frame and proper lighting. The first half is a bit rough. Sierra keeps looking directly into the camera in a way that's more distracting than seductive. Why does she always seem bored when her girlfriend is eating her out? Or maybe she just has a sex resting bitch face? Either way, it doesn't do it for me personally.</p>

          <p>The second half of the video does get better. There's more fluidity, more connection, more chemistry, thank god. It still feels like we get to watch two girls just messing around on camera. Sometimes it's hot, sometimes it's awkward, but one thing for sure is that it never feels fake. Also, now it's obvious that Sierra is a top, lol.</p>

          <h3>"SkylarAngelxx has an appetite"</h3>
          <p>A video with the girlfriend again. First, the lighting is on point. The angle is pretty good. And this time, Sierra looks directly at the camera throughout the scene in a way that is actually hot. I felt like a voyeur who was caught perving, and I liked that. That said, the second half, a close-up dildo scene, didn't do it for me for reasons already stated. I'm the type of girl who wants to see it all, especially for pussy eating scenes.</p>

          <p>So far, I watched but it didn't get me to touch myself, just some light clit tingling. And it's not going to get better.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="boy-girl-solo">
          <h2>No solo and no (boy) dick for me, thank you !</h2>
          
          <h3>B/G content</h3>
          <p>That "Ricky long dick" started to be featured in every video. Men probably like seeing "average dude" fucking hot girls. I get it. But if the guy isn't attractive, don't show his face. There's a reason most mainstream porn hides male faces. Actually, two. First, most people do not watch porn to see men, which includes straight women who mainly watch lesbian porn. Secondly, they are ugly.</p>

          <p>And then, there was more B/G content. No face, thank god.</p>

          <h3>Solo Content</h3>
          <p>Now for her solo content. I didn't talk about it because I have nothing good to say about it. Sierra is not a performer; she seems more of an exhibitionist, and when I watch her shoving a dildo in her pussy, I just see a girl shoving a dildo in her pussy, not a girl pleasuring herself.</p>

          <p>There is nothing erotic about it because she barely tries to make it erotic. Nobody should have a resting bitch face while showing a dildo inside their pussy.</p>

        <section id="what-worked">
          <h2>What Actually turned me on (aka my clit said yes lit)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wide angle girlfriend scenes</strong> - I liked the scene parts with her girlfriend with wide angle. I liked seeing both of them having intimate sex.</li>
            <li><strong>Pussy from the back pics</strong> - It's the prettiest pussy view. Period. There is a picture with the caption "Top 3 things you do to me" where you see her asshole and pussy that I found genuinely hot.</li>

        <section id="verdict">
          <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
          <p>Sierra Jade's OnlyFans is a study in raw authenticity that doesn't always translate to arousing content. While her unfiltered, punk aesthetic is genuinely different from the polished Instagram-style pages flooding the platform, it comes at the cost of actual eroticism.</p>

          <p>Her content feels like watching someone's private sex life rather than curated adult entertainment. Sometimes that works - when the chemistry is right and the angles align. More often, it results in awkward energy, poor performance quality, and missed opportunities for genuine heat.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>Would I recommend ?</h4>
            <p><strong>Not really</strong> - Sierra's page offers authentic amateur content at a low price point, but lacks the erotic energy and performance quality that makes adult content actually arousing. Great for voyeurs who prioritize realness over heat.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Who This OnlyFans Is For</h3>
          <p>You love really amateur, indie porn, you LOVE POV and you value authenticity and intimacy over production and editing. If you're looking for polished lesbian content that will actually get you off, this probably isn't it.</p>
